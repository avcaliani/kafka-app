# üì´ Kafka App

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/avcaliani/kafka-app?logo=apache&color=lightseagreen)

This is my Apache Kafka repository.  
Here you will find some stuff that I've done while I was learning about how to work with Apache Kafka.

## Repository Tags

- `v1.0` - Here you will find some PoCs that produce and consume data from Kafka developed in Spring Boot, PySpark and Python.
- `v2.0` - Here you will find the projects I've created while doing a Kafka course from Alura.

The `master` branch will have the most recent code that I've created, to check more details of a past development checkout the specific tag you want.

## Projects

- Project 01 - TBD

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è To execute the projects you will need a Kafka instance running, to create your check the [next section](#quick-start).

### Quick Start

In this section we are going to up a local Kafka.

```bash
# Build & Up
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d

# Logs
docker-compose logs kafka

# Shutting Down
docker-compose down
```

### Playground

Here are some terminal commands you can try to explore your own Kafka \o/

```bash
# Create your first topic \o/
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics.sh \
    --create \
    --bootstrap-server "localhost:9092" \
    --replication-factor "1" \
    --partitions "1" \
    --topic "MY_TOPIC"

# Check the available topics
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server "localhost:9092"

# Producing messages ‚úâÔ∏è
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-console-producer.sh \
    --broker-list "localhost:9092" \
    --topic "MY_TOPIC"

# Consuming messages üîé
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-console-consumer.sh \
    --bootstrap-server "localhost:9092" \
    --topic "MY_TOPIC" --from-beginning

# Cheking our topics
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-consumer-groups.sh \
    --all-groups \
    --describe \
    --bootstrap-server "localhost:9092"
```

### Interesting Stuff

**What about having multiple consumers on the same topic?**
You can have multiple consumers subscribed to the same topic.  
If their group ids are different, then all of them will receive the messages.  
If they belong to the same group id the consumers will be divided to read the available partitions. This means the consumers in the same group won't be receiving the same messages, this also means that you CAN'T have more consumers than partitions, because if you do the extra consumers will have no use, since no partitions will be assigned to them.

**How does the Kafka split the messages within the partitions?**  
Kafka defines the message partition based on the message key.

**Rebalancing Issues**  
One way to avoid issues related to Kafka rebalancing is setting the "max poll records" configuration to `1`.  
In this way the consumer will receive 1 message at a time, so if the rebalance happens the Kafka may lose the track at maximum of 1 record.
